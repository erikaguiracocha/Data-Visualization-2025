NJDEP clipped the data using the detailed and updated layer \"NJDEP Coastline of New Jersey\"  for various uses.

It is not a survey document and should not be used as such.  The polygons delineated in this data set do not represent legal boundaries.\n\nThis data set improves upon previous versions of municipal boundaries through the integration of coincident features from several high quality source data sets, as a component of the OGIS statewide Parcels Normalization Project concluded in March 2010.  Updates continue to be made as necessary.\n","tags":["boundaries","njfw_boundaries","municipal","municipality","municipalities","village","borough","town","township","city","county","counties","boundary","boundaries","minor civil divisions","Govt_admin_mun_coast_bnd","muncoast","Burlington County","Camden County","Cape May County","Cumberland County","Essex County","Gloucester County","Hudson County","Hunterdon County","Mercer County","Middlesex County","Monmouth County","Morris County","New Jersey","Ocean County","Passaic County","Salem County","Somerset County","Sussex County","Union County","Warren County","NJ","Atlantic County","Bergen County","USA"],"snippet":"To provide basic jurisdictional information.
