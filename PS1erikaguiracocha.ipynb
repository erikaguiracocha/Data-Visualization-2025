        "variables you are interested in and why?; (and as always– give exact url for data!)\n",
        "**Dataset Overview and Research Focus:**\n",
        "For this analysis, I am examining data from 21 counties in New Jersey over the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 to explore the relationship between crime rates and police budget allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Research Question:**\n",
        "How does the crime rate in counties across New Jersey influence the allocation of police budgets?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hypothesis:**\n",
        "I hypothesize that counties with higher crime rates will allocate a greater proportion of their budget to police services. This is because counties with higher crime rates will need to direct more resources toward law enforcement to manage the increased demand for police intervention and services.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variables of Interest**:\n",
        "1. **Crime Data:** The total number of crimes reported in each county per year. This variable serves as a proxy for the level of crime in the area and is expected to influence budget allocation for law enforcement.\n",
        "2. **Police Budget:**  The total amount of money allocated to the police department in each county. This budget is critical for understanding how local governments prioritize law enforcement funding relative to other services.\n",
        "3. **County:**The name of each county in New Jersey. This variable is important for comparing trends across different regions within the state.\n",
        "4. **Year:** The year in which the data was collected (2020, 2021, 2022). Temporal trends will be considered, as changes over time may affect the budget allocation or crime rates due to policy changes, economic factors, or other influences.\n",
        "**Data Sources:**\n",
        "1.\t**Crime Data:** The crime data will be obtained from the State of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety Office of Attorney General. This office provides crime statistics from municipalities and counties across the state as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The data will include reported crime numbers, categorized by crime type, and provide an insight into crime trends across New Jersey.\n",

        "2.\t**Police Budget Data:** The New Jersey Division of Local Government Services provides annual budget reports that detail county spending, including allocations for the police department. These reports are publicly available and provide valuable data on how counties allocate funds, including for law enforcement.\n",

        "3.\t**Socioeconomic Data:** The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development provides population data, including county-level population estimates.

        "**Data Justification:**\n",
        "The datasets selected are relevant because they directly address the research question of how crime rates correlate with police budget allocation. The crime data from the UCR database will provide a comprehensive view of crime in New Jersey’s counties, while the police budget data will allow us to analyze the financial resources allocated to law enforcement. Socioeconomic data, such as population size, will help contextualize the findings, as larger populations might inherently require more policing resources.\n",
        "By using data from multiple years (2020, 2021, and 2022), this analysis can identify any trends or shifts in how counties respond to changes in crime rates over time and the effect of these changes on budget allocation.\n"
